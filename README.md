1. Project Overview
This application provides a modern customer support chat experience. The Ionic Angular frontend ensures a seamless user interface across various devices. The Node.js backend, powered by Socket.io, enables real-time, bidirectional communication between the client and the server, making the chat experience highly responsive. All intelligent responses are generated by integrating with OpenAI's powerful language models.

2. Features
Real-time Chat: Instant message delivery using Socket.io.

AI-Powered Responses: Utilizes OpenAI to provide smart, context-aware chatbot replies.

Responsive UI: Ionic Angular frontend adapts to web, mobile, and tablet screens.

Modular Backend: Node.js API handles chat logic and OpenAI integration.

Scalable Architecture: Designed for easy extension and deployment.

3. Prerequisites
Before you start, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

Node.js & npm: Download and install the latest LTS version from nodejs.org. npm is included with Node.js.

Ionic CLI: Install globally using npm:

npm install -g @ionic/cli

OpenAI API Key: You'll need an API key from the OpenAI Platform to enable AI responses.

4. Getting Started
Follow these steps to get the application up and running on your local machine.

Backend Setup (Node.js)
Navigate to the backend directory:

cd backend

Install dependencies:

npm install

Configure Environment Variables:

Copy the example environment file:

cp .env.example .env

Open the newly created .env file and add your OpenAI API Key:

# .env
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
# Add other environment variables like PORT if needed
# PORT=3000

Important: Replace sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx with your actual OpenAI secret key.

Frontend Setup (Ionic Angular)
Navigate to the frontend directory:

cd chatbot-app

Install dependencies:

npm install

Configure Backend URL (if necessary):

Open your frontend's environment or service file (e.g., src/environments/environment.ts or a chat service file) where the backend URL is defined.

Ensure it points to your Node.js backend (e.g., http://localhost:3000 if your Node.js backend runs on port 3000). For Socket.io, this might be configured differently than a REST endpoint.

5. Running the Application
To run the full application, you need to start both the backend and the frontend in separate terminal windows.

Start the Node.js Backend:

In your terminal, ensure you are in the backend/ directory.

Run the backend server:

npm start

The backend will typically start on http://localhost:3000 (check your backend's console output for the exact port).

Start the Ionic Angular Frontend:

Open a new terminal and navigate to the chatbot-app/ directory.

Run the Ionic development server:

ionic serve

The frontend will usually open in your default web browser at http://localhost:8100.

Now, your AI Chatbot application should be fully operational, and you can start interacting with it through the browser!

6. CI/CD (Optional)
This project can be integrated into a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using tools like Jenkins. A sample Jenkinsfile (which would be located in the repository root) could automate:

Code Checkout

Frontend Build & Test: npm install, npm run build --prod, npm test

Backend Build & Test: npm install, npm test

Dockerization: Building Docker images for both frontend (e.g., Nginx serving static files) and backend (Node.js app).

Deployment: Deploying the built artifacts/Docker images to a staging or production environment.

Refer to Jenkins documentation and examples for configuring Jenkinsfile for Node.js and Ionic projects if you choose to set this up.
